Performance degradation due to adding checks for non-negative capacity and size in Array::fill and Array::empty.

## 7bd496c3cd6245f5604df0f2fb1ca96b657fe05e

Due to changes in the implementation of the check_range function.
In the previous commit e4e3a33dd436b06bd8126d4e273ab17957c483e2, check_range was already introduced, but it only displayed an error message and aborted.
Between that commit and 7bd496c3cd6245f5604df0f2fb1ca96b657fe05e, fixruntime_index_out_of_range was defined in runtime.c and changed to be called from check_range.
This caused performance degradation.
Note that we forgot to run the benchmark immediately after changing the check_range function implementation, so the impact appeared in the benchmark of a slightly later commit.
